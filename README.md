### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I learned how to work with classes to inject some css styling into the page. 

IE

```
<div class="box">
```

This project was mainly a refresher for me to get back into front-end development.
I did not use flexbox as I do not currently know how to correctly utilize that technology.
